This contain the current code. This is severely outdated, and not compatible with the coralLib and beijbomToolbox repos.

For this to run, there are two external things that need to be setup.
1) The liblinear libraray needs to be installed. In particular these two files needs to be compiled and located in these hard-coded locations:
/home/beijbom/e/Code/apps/libsvm/svm-predict
/home/beijbom/e/Code/apps/libsvm/svm-train
I'm using version 2.9-1, but I suspect newer version will work fine.

2) This file also needs to exist:
/home/beijbom/e/Code/beijbom/projects/featureCat/featureCat
It's a custom written script by Oscar, that is only tested on LINUX. So, contact oscar at oscar.beijbom@gmail.com if you need it.
