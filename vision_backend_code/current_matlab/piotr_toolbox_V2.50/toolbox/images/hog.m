function H = hog( I, varargin )
% Efficiently compute histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features.
%
% Code to compute HOG features as described in "Histograms of Oriented
% Gradients for Human Detection" by Dalal & Triggs, CVPR05. Various speedup
% tricks adopted from the HOG code feature.cpp by Deva Ramanan.
%
% If I has dimensions [mxn], the size of the computed feature vector H is
% [m/sBin-2 n/sBin-2 oBin*4]. For each non-overlapping sBin x sBin region,
% computes a histogram of gradients, with each gradient quantized by it's
% angle and weighed by its magnitude. For color images, the gradient is
% computed separately for each color channel and the one with maximum
% magnitude is used. The centered gradient is used except at boundaries
% (where uncentered gradient is used). Trilinear interpolation is used to
% place each gradient in the appropriate spatial and orientation bin. For
% each resulting histogram (with oBin bins), four different normalizations
% are computed using adjacent histograms, resulting in an oBins*4 length
% feature vector for each region. Boundary regions are discarded.
%
% The computed features are NOT identical to those described in the CVPR05
% paper. Specifically, there is no Gaussian spatial window, and other minor
% details differ. The choices were made for speed of the resulting code:
% ~.1s for a 640x480x3 color image on a standard machine from 2005. Further
% speedups can be obtained by not using trilinear interpolation (e.g.,
% setting oGran=1 results in a ~33% speedup at some loss in accuracy).

% USAGE
%  H = hog( I, [sBin], [oBin], [oGran] )
%
% INPUTS
%  I        - [mxn] color or grayscale input image (must have type double)
%  sBin     - [8] spatial bin size
%  oBin     - [9] number of orientation bins
%  oGran    - [10] controls quality of linear interpolation for orientation
%
% OUTPUTS
%  H        - [m/sBin-2 n/sBin-2 oBin*4] computed hog features
%
% EXAMPLE
