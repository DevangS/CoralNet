{"name":"CoralNet","body":"### Goal\r\nCoralNet aims to build an easy to use web application for coral researchers to perform their research with. There already exist some desktop solutions but they tied down to the physical computers and hard drives that contain the relevant data. We instead provide a web annotation tool with all your data stored on our server, so the only thing researchers have to worry about is their research. \r\n\r\n### For Researchers\r\n1. Signup for an account at [CoralNet](http://coralnet.ucsd.edu)\r\n1. Upload your images\r\n2. Annotate them yourself\r\n3. Have a \"robot\" help you out to make things go faster (Optional)\r\n4. Browse your dataset's annotations, and view automatically generated statistics for them\r\n5. Export your data\r\n6. Get published in top tier conference\r\n\r\n### For Developers\r\nWhile CoralNet is open source, a lot of the documentation to run it on a production server is currently internal. Our primary goal is to write features and fix bugs. Once we are done with that, we aim to create an easy setup guide to get your own version of CoralNet working. In the mean time, feel free to contact us if you want to request a specific feature, or discuss our computer vision algorithm!\r\n\r\n### Who we are \r\nDevelopment is based out of the University of California San Diego in collaboration with coral researchers at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography\r\n","tagline":"A web based collaboration tool for utilizing computer vision methods to analyze coral reefs.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
