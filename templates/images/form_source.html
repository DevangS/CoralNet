        <span class="helptext_long">
        This is how you organize your source's images.  Location keys are a hierarchy of categories.
        As the name suggests, location keys typically refer to the location where the image was taken,
        but this is not strictly required.  Here's an example:<br /><br />

        Suppose you take your coral images at 3 different islands: North, South, and East.  At each
        island, you take photos at 3 different coral habitats based on their distance from the shore:
        Fringing Reef, 5m out, and 10m out.  For each island + habitat combination, you have multiple
        images with no particular organization to them.<br /><br />

        In this case you would have 3 location keys: Key 1 would be Island, Key 2 would be Habitat, and
        Key 3 would be something arbitrary to differentiate between images, like Number.  When you
        upload an image, you'll specify the "location values" that correspond to each of these keys.
        For example, one image may have the values North, 5m out, and 4, indicating that it's the 4th
        image that is from North island at 5m out.<br /><br />

        {% if source_form_type == "new" %}
            You can have 1 to 5 location keys, depending on how much organization you need.  Once you've
            uploaded some images, you'll be able to search through them using location values: you can
            search for all the images that are from the North island, all the images that are from the
            South island's fringing reef, and so on.<br /><br />

            NOTE: Once you create your source, you cannot change the number of location keys.
            You'll only be able to change the keys' names.  So please take the time now to think
            carefully about the organization of your source.
			NOTE2: The image acquisition date is always part of the image metadata, along with several other fields, such as camera, water quality etc. There is therefore no need to use e.g. 'year' as a location key.

            Once you've uploaded some images, you'll be able to search through them using location
            values: you can search for all the images that are from the North island, all the images
            that are from the South island's fringing reef, and so on.<br /><br />

            NOTE: Since you are editing a source that's already been created, you cannot change the
            number of location keys.  You can only change the keys' names.

        <span class="helptext_long">
        {# Possible shorter explanation: #}
        {#Auto-accept the machine annotator's suggestions when its confidence is above this percentage.<br/><br/>#}
        {#This auto-acceptance happens when you enter the annotation tool for an image. Effectively, the machine's most confident points are \"alleviated\" from your annotation workload (for that image).<br/><br/>#}
        {#A machine confidence level above 100% is impossible, so set it to 100 to disable this feature.#}

        The machine learning algorithm (we call her "Cora" sometimes) running on the CoralNet server generates posterior probabilities for each annotation. For example, the posterior probabilities for a certain location in a certain image may be: Acropora with 90% confidence, Sand with 6% and Algae with 4%, meaning that Cora is 90% confident that the correct annotation is Acropora. The details of how these posterior probabilities are generated can be seen in Section 8 of the <a href="http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/libsvm.pdf">Libsvm documentation</a>.<br/><br/>
        These posterior probabilities are shown by default in the popup that appears during manual annotation process, and facilitate faster label-selection by the human operator (we call this the 'refine' annotation mode).<br/><br/>
        To further utilize the machine learning algorithm, we allow users to specify a confidence threshold below. Any annotation decision with a posterior probability higher than this threshold will automatically be accepted when you enter the annotation tool for that image. Effectively, the machine's most confident points are "alleviated" from your annotation workload (for that image). Alleviated annotation decisions are treated as 'verified' by the human, and are included when you export your annotations. (Robot annotations that have <strong>not</strong> been verified can optionally also be included in your export (see the 'export' page) ).<br/><br/>
        A study on how alleviation affects estimation quality of key ecological indicators is currently in submission, and will be shared upon publication. The study suggests that a threshold around 90 or 95% only marginally affects estimation quality while offering up to 50% reduction of manual annotation work. The machine confidence can never be 100%, so set the confidence threshold to 100 to disable this feature.
