To activate the maintenance message, uncomment the line specifying the
maintenance time:
{% set_maintenance_time "12:00 AM" as maintenance_time %}

If the maintenance time is in the future, then the maintenance message
will say the site will be under maintenance.  If the maintenance time is
in the past, then the maintenance message will say the site is under
maintenance.

There are three accepted formats for the maintenance time.

(1) Time of day.  This should correctly infer your intended date + time, as long
as the date + time you intended is within 12 hours from the current time:
{% set_maintenance_time "12:00 AM" as maintenance_time %}

(2) Month, day, and time.  If you want to announce maintenance more than
12 hours in advance, or if maintenance might go on for over 12 hours, or
if you just want to be unambiguous, then use this:
{% set_maintenance_time "Mar 21 12:00 AM" as maintenance_time %}

(3) Year, month, day, and time.  Usually won't need this, but use this
if you want to make sure your date and time aren't ambiguous:
{% set_maintenance_time "2012 Mar 21 12:00 AM" as maintenance_time %}

If you formatted the date incorrectly (like "2012 March 21 12:00 AM")
then the maintenance message won't appear.  The website won't show an
error on the browser side, though.  On the other hand, if you have a
template syntax error (like missing a quotation mark), then the website
will error, so be careful!

To take down the maintenance message, just comment out the line that
sets the maintenance time:
{# {% set_maintenance_time "12:00 AM" as maintenance_time %} #}

{% endcomment %}


{# {% set_maintenance_time "12:00 AM" as maintenance_time %} #}

{% if maintenance_time %}
    <div class="maintenance_message">
        {% if maintenance_time|timeuntil == "0 minutes" %}
            {# The message when the site is currently under maintenance. #}
            <b>The site is under maintenance.</b>
            During maintenance, the site may abruptly become unavailable,
            and certain pages may not work properly. If you're going to
            upload or change anything, we advise you to use the site at
            a later time.  Weâ€™re sorry for the inconvenience.
        {% else %}
            {# The message when the site is going to be under maintenance at a particular time. #}
            The site will be under maintenance starting <b>{{ maintenance_time }},
            U.S. Pacific time.</b>
        {% endif %}
    </div>
