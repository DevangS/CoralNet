<h1 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.1px 0.0px; font: 24.0px Times"><b>About CoralNet</b></h1>
<p class="p3">CoralNet is a repository and a resource for benthic images analysis. It was created as part of an NSF project, <span class="s1">Computer Vision Coral Ecology</span> by researchers at UCSD in 2012. The site implements sophisticated computer vision algorithms that allow researchers, agencies, and private partners to rapidly annotate benthic survey images. The site also serves as a repository and collaboration platform for the scientific community.</p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.9px 0.0px; font: 18.0px Times"><b>Background</b></h2>
<p class="p3">Global warming and local anthropogenic stressors are causing severe stress to coral reefs across the world. To take appropriate action decision makers need accurate data over large spatio-temporal scales. The speed of data collection has increased tremendously in recent years, thanks to proliferation of digital cameras and underwater autonomous, or remotely operated, vehicles. As a result, millions of images are collected each years across the world. The subsequent analysis, however, remains painfully slow as manual inspection of each photo is required by a trained expert.</p>
<p class="p3">Recent progress in machine learning and computer vision offer a compelling solution to this problem: a machine-annotator can learn from human labels and then proceed to rapidly process large numbers of new images.</p>
<p class="p3">CoralNet offers an open-source framework to approach this solution. It serves as a repository of benthic images, and allow for different modes of interaction between the machine-annotator and the human expert. CoralNet, by itâ€™s nature, also provides a platform for collaboration / sharing of data.</p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.9px 0.0px; font: 18.0px Times"><b>Data Agreement</b></h2>
<p class="p3">CoralNet are committed to protecting the data privacy of itâ€™s users, and offer two privacy options which are set of the <span class="s1">Source</span> level.</p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Times"><b>Private</b></h3>
<p class="p3">All your images and annotations are hidden from the public. Your project will however appear in the source listing and map, so that other researchers / interested parties can find you. The only information we will share is thus:</p>
<p class="p3">1. Name of source</p>
<p class="p3">2. Source description and affiliation</p>
<p class="p3">3. Latitude and Longitude of your sites</p>
<p class="p3">4. Total number of images in your <span class="s1">source</span></p>
<p class="p3">All other information remains hidden from the public. CoralNet also reserves the right to let the computer vision algorithm learn from annotation made on private sources. This will in no way compromise the integrity of your data, but it will help further boost the efficiency of the machine-annotator for all users. Note: According to the US National Science Foundation guidelines on data policy, all scientific information should be made publicly available two years after collection. We therefore encourage users to switch their privacy setting from Private to Public when appropriate.</p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Times"><b>Public</b></h3>
<p class="p3">In addition to the information shared in the private mode, all your source images and annotation data will be available for the public to browse and download (including original images in full resolution). We encourage all users to consider this privacy option.</p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.9px 0.0px; font: 18.0px Times"><b>The site</b></h2>
<p class="p3">The CoralNet website consist of several modules:</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Source creation:</b> Your â€œsourceâ€ is your space at CoralNet. You specify what labelset you want to use, your privacy settings, and invite collaborators to your source. The source interface also allows you to organize your images by a number of locationkeys, such as â€œsiteâ€, â€œhabitatâ€, â€œdepthâ€.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Labelset:</b> Specify what labels you want to use in your analysis. Choose from a set of already created labels or create your own if needed.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Import:</b> Upload images to the server. You can also import annotation already completed in other systems such as Coral Point Count.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Annotation:</b> Annotate your image right in the web browser using a point count interface. CoralNet supports manual annotation, as well as semi-automated modes. Several users can annotate the same set of images at the same time, and the system tracks who annotated what. After each annotation session, the CoralNet machine annotator will read your annotation and improve its prediction on your next batch of images.</p>
<p class="p3">The computer vision algorithm used by CoralNet was developed in the following publication: â€œAutomatic Annotation of Coral Reef Survey Imagesâ€, Beijbom, O. and Edmunds, P.J. and Kline, D.I. and Mitchell, B.G. and Kriegman, D., Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012 IEEE Conference on, Rhode Island 2012.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Statistics:</b> Get statistics detailing the coverage of each category in your labelset along with aggregated functional group level statistics.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Export:</b> Export all images and annotations to your desktop for backup or further processing.</p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.9px 0.0px; font: 18.0px Times"><b>Funding support</b></h2>
<p class="p3">CoralNet development is support by the NSF Computer Vision Coral Ecology grant #ATM-0941760. We ask that you cite the following paper if you have used CoralNet in your work</p>
